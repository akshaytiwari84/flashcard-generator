# Flashcard Generator with React

Flashcard Generator is a powerful study tool developed with React that allows users to create, manage, and study flashcards effortlessly. This application provides a comprehensive solution for organizing and reviewing information in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

## Key Features

- *Create Flashcard:* Users can easily create new flashcards by filling out a simple form. The main flashcard form includes fields for the flashcard title, and a description. The term form allows users to add multiple terms to the flashcard, with fields for the term title and definition. Additional terms can be dynamically added or removed as needed.

- *My Flashcards:* This page provides an overview of all the flashcards created by the user. Each flashcard is displayed with its title and description, allowing for quick navigation to the desired flashcard.

- *Flashcard Details:* Users can view the details of a specific flashcard on this page. The flashcard's title and description are shown at the top, while the list of terms is displayed on the left side. Clicking on a term will display its details prominently in the center. Users can navigate between terms using an intuitive carousel with arrows at the bottom.

- *Share Flashcards:* Users have the option to share their flashcards by clicking on the share button. This opens a modal containing a unique link to the flashcard, along with a copy button for easy sharing with others.

- allowing users to access their study materials offline. This feature provides added convenience and flexibility for studying on the go.
